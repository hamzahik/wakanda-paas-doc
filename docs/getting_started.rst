**************************************
Publishing & updating your application
**************************************

Publishing your code the first time is the same as updating an already deployed application. All you need to do is push your code to your application's remote repository.

Application remote repository
=============================

It is an unique URL that points to your cloud git repository.  The URL information is available in the appâ€™s git repository section.

Having the "application remote repository" allows you to push code using the Wakanda Studio,  or a  Git Command Line, or any IDE that supports Git Smart HTTP.

Using Wakanda Studio
====================
Create a local git repository and commit your changes by adding all the folders you want to source control. After that, define your remote repository and deploy whenever you are ready to your cloud. 

Create your local git repository
********************************
From the solution explorer on Wakanda Studio, open the Git Panel and click on ``Create Git Repository``.

Using the command line
======================

Push your application to the remote repository by using the following command ::

    $ git push https://[my-application-name].us-git.wak-apps.com master

.. note::

    If your local repository is using a branch name other than ``master``, you must use the following command to push your application to the remote repository ::

    $ git push https://[my-application-name].us-git.wak-apps.com [local-branch-name]:master
    
*********************************
